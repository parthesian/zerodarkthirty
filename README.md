# Basketball Analytics Pipeline

A comprehensive basketball video analysis system that uses computer vision and machine learning to track players, detect actions, and generate game statistics from video footage.

## 🏀 Features

- **Player & Ball Tracking**: Multi-object tracking with persistent IDs using SAM2 segmentation
- **Action Recognition**: Classify basketball actions (shoot, pass, dribble, rebound, off-ball movement)
- **Event Detection**: Automatically detect game events and generate statistics
- **Domain Adaptation**: Works on both professional NBA footage and amateur gym videos
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for local GPU inference

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a modular pipeline architecture:

1. **Video Ingestion & Preprocessing**
2. **Object Detection & SAM2 Segmentation** 
3. **Multi-Object Tracking**
4. **Pose Estimation & Action Classification**
5. **Event Detection & Statistics Generation**
6. **Output Generation** (Annotated video + JSON stats)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download models
python scripts/download_models.py

# Process a video
python main.py --input video.mp4 --output results/
```
